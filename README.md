# FileSenderBot
A Discord bot that watches folders for new files, renames them and attaches them to a discord message


This bot is based on Discord.js v13

Add your information in to config.json to set it up

The bot is created to run on windows server 2022. Not sure how it will run under any other OS, especially becauase the file creation date/time is handled different per OS and per NodeJS version, as well as fs version.

Feel free to commit and fork.

to install just use

"git clone https://github.com/mr190e/FileSenderBot/"
